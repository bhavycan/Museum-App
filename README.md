Secondly, To develop a modern, responsive user interface for searching and viewing data on the publicly available Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API.  By using the  knowledge of React, Next.js and React Bootstrap to develop my solution.  However, if you wish to use a different UI library such as Material UI, etc. or add additional images, styles or functionality, please go ahead. I have also attacted the linked below:
